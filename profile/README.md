The **Emacsmirror** is a growing collection of [Emacs] Lisp packages.  All
mirrored packages are available as [Git] repositories.  In most cases this is
done by mirroring the upstream Git repository, but if upstream uses something
else, then the mirror nevertheless makes the package available as a Git
repository.

* The best way to add a package to the Emacsmirror, is to add it to Melpa
  instead.  After it has been added there, it usually also appears on the
  mirror within a few days.

If a package is no longer maintained upstream, it is usually moved from the
Emacsmirror to the **Emacsattic**.  Such packages are usually also removed
from Melpa.

The **Emacsorphanage** also contains packages that are no longer maintained
upstream, but which still have users or are still required by some other
packages.  In the orphanage they receive only limited maintenance.  Some of
the packages in the orphanage are there for different reasons.

* If you would like to become the new maintainer of a package, then please
  contact us.

* If you no longer want to maintain a package, then transferring it to the
  orphanage is an alternative to just archiving the repository.  That way, we
  can keep it usable, and if someone volunteers to become the new maintainer,
  you do not have to be involved in the process.
